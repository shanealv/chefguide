A basic thickener useful for thickening soups, souces, and gravy. As the flour
cooks, it looses it's raw flour flavor. With extended cooking times, the cooler
of the roux deepens, trading thickening power for nutty flavors.

# Ingredients

- 1 part flour
- 1 part oil/butter/fat

# Equipment

- sauce pan
- whisk

# Directions

1. heat a sauce pan over low heat
2. add fat to the sauce pan
   1. if using butter, heat until bubbling subsides to remove water
3. add flour and stir
4. continue heating until desired color achieved

# Tips

- roux can be prepared faster over higher-heat, though with more stirring and
  over a shorter period
- butter has a few pros and cons:
  - moisture is best boiled off before adding flour
  - milk solids bring additional nutty flavors
  - milk solids will color the roux, making determining doneness difficult
- roux creation is often integrated into recipes
  - e.g., coating meat when searing for stews, adding to sauted onion, etc.
  - roux can often be prepared separately and added later for greater control
